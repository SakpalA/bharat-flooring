                    Over the decades Bharat has laid some of the best-known floors in Indiaâ€™s landmark buildings: from palaces of Maharajas and Raj Bhavans to prominent residences, hotels, hospitals, clubs, offices, factories, co-operative housing societies, educational and religious institutions, airports, railways etc.</p>
                <p className='man-head-para'>Each step has to be done well. <br />
                    The best European technologies were brought and modified to create a unique product suited to Indian conditions. Recognising that a good floor is only achieved with a good product that is installed correctly and maintained properly, the company has sister companies which do high quality installation of all types of floorings, a range of civil work, floor maintenance and general cleaning.</p>
